## Project description

Aortic stenosis (AS), or narrowing of the aortic valve, is the commonest reason for having heart valve surgery in the west, that causes poor quality of life and death, if untreated. It affects ~1-in-20 adults aged >65, but the exact number and characteristics of those affected is unknown. The only treatment is to replace the valve, either through open heart surgery: surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or less invasive, ‘keyhole’ approach called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

Differences in treatment and outcomes in people from ethnic minorities and poorer backgrounds have been reported. The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted, and possibly increased health inequalities in the UK.
